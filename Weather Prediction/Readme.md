Analysed  historical weather data using the Naive Bayes algorithm with a Gaussian distribution assumption.
Goal was to predict future weather conditions based on observed features such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, 
leveraging probabilistic classification to estimate the likelihood of different weather outcomes.
